First, make sure you have the following in your directory:

- makefile
- src/functions.cc
- src/heapsort.cc
- inc/functions.h
- input.txt
- bin/ (directory)
Second, type "make clean", press enter,  then "make" or "make heapsort" then enter into the command line.

Third, type "./heapsort" into the command line 

Check "output.txt" in the directory, the first line is a constructed heap of the data and the second line is the sorted data from smallest to largest using the heapsort algorithm.
